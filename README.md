# 3D-MMORPG
Absolutely 100% unsupported, and full of infuriating bugs.

No wait, that's not right!

Now it <em>is</em> supported, and it is <em>not</em> full of infuriating bugs! Feel free to fork this project (use for non-comercial projects only).

# Steps to run
1. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed.
2. Open up a new command prompt inside the <kbd>server</kbd> folder, and run `npm install`. You only need to run this once, and then you can continue with the other commands.
3. Run `node index.mjs`. Leave it running in that terminal, and open up a new one in the <kbd>client</kbd> folder.
4. Run `npm install -g http-server`. Again, this is only a one-time step.
5. Now, run `http-server`, and open any of the links given. There it is!

# Notes
1. Steps two and four are the only ones which need to be executed once. All the other commands MUST be executed in order for the game to run.
2. I will try to maintain this to the best of my ability, but I am not very good at coding - not as good as simondev - so please do try to help if you want an update. (Add a village or something if you want - go crazy with it!)
